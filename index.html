            Hi! My name is Luke Quest Davey, and this is a website version of my CV, and a little bit of info about me.
            Presently, I am doing work experience at <a href="https://www.learnerme.ac.nz/">LearnerMe,</a> Innovation
            Headquarters, and I am finding that code is a lot less daunting than it may seem at first, and actually
            seems
            pretty
            fun!
        </p>

        <h2 class="georgia-font">Education</h2>

        <p>
        <h4>I have attended 4 locations of schooling in my educative years. A preschool, primary school, and two
            secondary schools.</h4>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>First off, I went to Playcentre New Plymouth for two years I think, from the ages of 3 to 5.</li>
            <li>Seccondly, I attended Vogeltown primary school for six years, of which I remember little of what I did,
                and
                only retained three proper friends, but altogether, it was fun.</li>
            <li>After year six, came year 7. I chose to go to <a href="https://www.fdmc.school.nz/">Francis Douglas
                    Memorial
                    College,</a> and for two miserable years, I made two friends, kept neither of them, and hated the
                school
                in general.</li>
            <li>Currently I consume my education through the means of <a href="https://www.spotswoodcollege.school.nz/">
                    Spotswood College,</a>where I have made many friends, and
                am getting ready for the outside world. I have been here since year nine, and I am currently at the
                start of
                year 12.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="georgia-font">My Hobbies</h2>

        <h4>I dont have many hobbies, but most are hand on, and often have something to do with tinkering with things
        </h4>

        <ul>
            <li>I love playing video games of many sorts, especially creative ones like <a
                    href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us">Minecraft</a></li>
            <li>Tinkering with and taking things apart is something that I like to do. For a small example; I often
                take apart pens that I
                have, to see what interesting mechanisms are inside.</li>
            <li>And lastly, I really like technology. Specifically computers, speakers and manufacturing as broad terms.
            </li>
            <li>I am also talented in 3D modeling using <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/">Tinkercad,</a> and 3D
                printing because I've recenly gotten an <a
                    href="https://www.creality.com/products/ender-3-3d-printer">Ender
                    3 FDM 3D printer</a></li>
